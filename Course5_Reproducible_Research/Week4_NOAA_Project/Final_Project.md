## Synopsis
A reproducible exploratory data analysis of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm data from January 1950 to November, 2011 is presented in this report. The objective of this analysis is to identify which weather events (a) cause the most harm to human health and (b) have the greatest economic impact. To answer these questions, data containing the human and economic impact of several severe weather events is downloaded from the Coursera website. The total number of human fatalities and injuries as a result of each weather event occurring between 1950 and 2011 and their total number per weather event were calculated. The data shows that Tornadoes, followed by either Excessive Heat, Floods, and Thunderstorms cause the most harm to humans. The total dollar value of Property and Crop damage as well as their total value for each weather event were calculated to estimate the economic impact. In contrast to the human toll, economic losses are highest due to Floods, followed by Hurricanes, Thunderstorms, and Tornadoes. Thus, different weather events have different economic and human impacts.
