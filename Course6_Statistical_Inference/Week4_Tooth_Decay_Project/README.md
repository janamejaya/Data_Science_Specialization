# Tooth Decay Dataset: Hypothesis Testing

## Synopsis
For the Tooth Growth dataset, several hypothesis are tested in order to identify the effect of supplement type and dose amount on tooth length. Based on hypothesis testing, we fail to reject the hypothesis that tooth length is dependent on supplement type and accept the alternative hypothesis that tooth length is dependent on supplement dose.
